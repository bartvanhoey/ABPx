## ABPx - A VsCode Extension to Speed Up the Development Process of an ABP Blazor Application

## Introduction

In this article, I would like to introduce ABPx to you. **ABPx** is a **VsCode Extension**, available in the **Visual Studio Marketplace**, to **speed up the Development** Process of an **ABP Blazor application** in **Visual Studio Code**. I noticed that the ABP Framework is rather **convention-based** and you often have to write the same code structures. That's why I have developed a VSCode Extension with useful code snippets to make the life of a developer a little easier.

Please feel free to install the **ABPx extension in VsCode**, and if you see room for improvement or you have a snippet in mind you want to have included? [Create an issue](https://github.com/bartvanhoey/ABPx/issues/new) in the ABPx repository. I will see what I can do! :-)

## Samples

### Generate an AppService class that inherits from the CrudAppService base class

In this article I make use of the free **Google SMTP Server** for sending emails,  in a real-world application however,  you probably would chose another **Email Delivery Service** like **SendGrid, Mailjet, etc.**

### Source Code

Get the [source code](hhttps://github.com/bartvanhoey/ABPx) of the **ABPx VsCode Extension** on GitHub.
